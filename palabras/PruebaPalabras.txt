This is a text in English, as my compilator is making it difficult for me to use Spanish accents.
It is ok, though. This is a test text and it will come in handy. I am sure this program will work
just fine with Spanish accents when using other compilators. Here I will set some test words that
will appear many times:

Daffodil daffodil daffodil daffodil daffodil
love you love you love you love you
potato potato potato potato potato potato
Spain Spain Spain Spain Spain Spain
I think this is enough. Have a nice day if you are reading this. Keep up the amazing job you are doing!
